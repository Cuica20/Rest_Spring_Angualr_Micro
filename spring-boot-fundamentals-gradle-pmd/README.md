## Languages

This project is authored in Java.

## Installation

### Fork the Repository

Fork the [Spring Boot Fundamentals](https://github.com/mwarman/spring-boot-fundamentals) repository on GitHub.  Clone the project to your host machine.

### Dependencies

The project requires the following dependencies be installed on the host machine:

* Java Development Kit 7 or later

and choose one of:
* Apache Maven 3 or later
* Gradle 2.4 or later

## Running

The project supports [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) and [Gradle](http://gradle.org/) for build, package, and test workflow automation.  

### Maven

The following Maven goals are the most commonly used.

#### spring-boot:run

The `spring-boot:run` Maven goal performs the following workflow steps:

* compiles Java classes to the /target directory
* copies all resources to the /target directory
* starts an embedded Apache Tomcat server

To execute the `spring-boot:run` Maven goal, type the following command at a terminal prompt in the project base directory.

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Type `ctrl-C` to halt the web server.

This goal is used for local machine development and functional testing.  Use the `package` goal for server deployment.

#### test

The `test` Maven goal performs the following workflow steps:

* compiles Java classes to the /target directory
* copies all resources to the /target directory
* executes the unit test suites
* produces unit test reports

The `test` Maven goal is designed to allow engineers the means to run the unit test suites against the main source code.  This goal may also be used on continuous integration servers such as Jenkins, etc.

To execute the `test` Maven goal, type the following command at a terminal prompt in the project base directory.

```
mvn clean test
```

#### package

The `package` Maven goal performs the following workflow steps:

* compiles Java classes to the /target directory
* copies all resources to the /target directory
* executes the unit test suites
* produces unit test reports
* prepares an executable JAR file in the /target directory

The `package` Maven goal is designed to prepare the application for distribution to server environments.  The application and all dependencies are packaged into a single, executable JAR file.

To execute the `package` goal, type the following command at a terminal prompt in the project base directory.

```
mvn clean package
```

The application distribution artifact is placed in the /target directory and is named using the `artifactId` and `version` from the pom.xml file.  To run the JAR file use the following command:

```
java -jar example-1.0.0.jar
```

By default, the batch and hsqldb profiles are active.  To run the application with a specific set of active profiles, supply the `--spring.profiles.active` command line argument.  For example, to start the project using MySQL instad of HSQLDB and enable the batch process:

```
java -jar example-1.0.0.jar --spring.profiles.active=mysql,batch
```

### Gradle

The following Gradle tasks are the most commonly used.

#### bootRun

The `bootRun` Gradle task performs the following workflow steps:

* compiles Java classes to the /build directory
* copies all resources to the /build directory
* starts an embedded Apache Tomcat server

To execute the `bootRun` Gradle task, type the following command at a terminal prompt in the project base directory.

```
gradle bootRun
```

Type `ctrl-C` to halt the web server.

This task is used for local machine development and functional testing.  Use the `assemble` or `build` task for server deployment.

#### assemble

The `assemble` Gradle task performs the following workflow steps:

* compiles Java classes to the /build directory
* copies all resources to the /build directory
* prepares an executable JAR file in the /build/libs directory

The `assemble` Gradle task is designed to allow engineers the means to compile the project and produce an executable JAR file suitable for server environments without executing unit tests or producing other project reports.

To execute the `assemble` Gradle task, type the following command at a terminal prompt in the project base directory.

```
gradle clean assemble
```

#### build

The `build` Gradle task performs the following workflow steps:

* compiles Java classes to the /build directory
* copies all resources to the /build directory
* executes the unit test suites
* produces unit test reports
* prepares an executable JAR file in the /build/libs directory

The `build` Gradle task is prepares the application for distribution to server environments. The application and all dependencies are packaged into a single, executable JAR file.

This task is ideal for use on continuous integration servers such as Jenkins, etc. because it produces unit test, code coverage, and static analysis reports.

To execute the `build` Gradle task, type the following command at a terminal prompt in the project base directory.

```
gradle clean build
```

The application distribution artifact is placed in the /build/libs directory and is named using the project name and version from the `build.gradle` file.  To run the JAR file use the following command:

```
java -jar build/libs/example-1.0.0.jar
```

By default, the batch and hsqldb profiles are active.  To run the application with a specific set of active profiles, supply the `--spring.profiles.active` command line argument.  For example, to start the project using MySQL instad of HSQLDB and enable the batch process:

```
java -jar build/libs/example-1.0.0.jar --spring.profiles.active=mysql,batch
```
